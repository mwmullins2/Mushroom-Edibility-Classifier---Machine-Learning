# Mushroom Edibility Classifier
This project is a machine learning application that uses a random forest classifier to predict the edibility of a mushroom based on its characteristics. The application reads data from a CSV file of mushroom characteristics and uses the following Python libraries:

* Matplotlib: for data visualization
* Scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms
* Pandas: for data manipulation
* NumPy: for numerical operations
* Seaborn: for data visualization
* ipywidgets: for creating a basic GUI

## Usage
To run the application, you need a Google account. Then click this link [--Mushroom ML- Google Colab--](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19Fs_7jkcgpOTttPhEFN8RhjTzvOcDjvZ?usp=sharing) to open the Notebook. The notebook contains all the code and instructions for running the application.

Once the notebook is running, you can use the GUI to input mushroom characteristics and get a prediction of its edibility. The GUI uses ipywidgets to create interactive widgets for selecting the mushroom characteristics.
